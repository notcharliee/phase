Phase is a free to use, open source Discord bot built by <UserHoverCard username="@notcharliee" avatar="https://github.com/notcharliee.png" bio="non-binary monster addict that codes things" joined="February 2022" url="https://github.com/notcharliee" />. It aims to be the all-in-one solution for as many servers as possible, with a large variety of different modules and commands.

Whether you're seeking to enhance a small server shared with friends or overseeing a bustling community, Phase is your solution for effectively managing, moderating, and improving your Discord experience.

## Why should you use Phase?

While popular bots like MEE6 or Dyno have their strengths, they lack transparency, tend to lock their best features behind ridiculously priced paywalls, and rarely add user-requested features. That's why I made Phase!
